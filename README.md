A browser-based geography game in which players guess locations from Google Street View imagery. This game is based on [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) but only uses locations in Taiwan. When the street image loads, you can click and drag to look around and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Then use the map at the bottom left to guess where you are. It is untimed and infinite, so you can play as long as you want.
